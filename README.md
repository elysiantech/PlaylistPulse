# Playlist Pulse ðŸŽ¶

**Playlist DJ for Spotify**

This project started as a simple exercise with my daughter, who has recently started DJ'ing. She wanted a way to quickly access music files based on Spotify playlists that she could practice DJ'ing with. Together, we decided to build an application that:

1. Interfaces with Spotify.
2. Captures and displays your playlists.
3. Lets you select which songs you'd like to work with.
4. Downloads the equivalent video from YouTube.
5. Extracts just the audio as an MP3 file.
6. Tags the MP3 file with proper metadata.

While I don't condone violating any restrictions or rules set by the music industry, this project was a wonderful opportunity to bond and explore app development together. It was created during a holiday hackathon, and while it doesnâ€™t do everything it could, it provides an easy way to practice DJing with Spotify playlists.
